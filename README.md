Hi There!

This is Ingrid Inara, hope you all are safe at home doing fine and protecting 
yourselves and your beloved ones.

Thankfully, IÂ´m safe and fine, writting my first commit change test here on GitHub, while 
trying to make my snappy vintage MAC understand that itÂ´s still time to rockÂ´n roll, as the 
real fun with codding is just about to start. ğŸ˜‰
